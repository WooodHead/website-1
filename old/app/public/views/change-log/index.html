                        The Change Log button on the navbar (at the top) will now show the number of unread changes for you to discover.

                    <p>
                        While it may not seem like a huge change, it's more of a quality of life thing. Currently announcements to changes to the site end up being on the homepage, which takes up about a half of the screen real-estate upon opening the page. It's highly likely (and on mobiles extremely likely) that you'll miss the all important statistics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore it made more sense to me to remove all the cruft from the homepage and announce changes via a "badge" (iOS sheeple will know this well) which will glow red when there's a new update in the change log that you've not read.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also done some various tidying up of the navbar in general. I'm going to also take a look at how the mobile navbar is set up as I'm not 100% happy with it.

                    <p class="center-align">
                        Having been absent from the website for quite some time now (and was on previous versions), I've added the Combat Statistics section, available on the <a href="/" class="ga-event" ga-campaign="Change Log" ga-action="Homepage - Combat">home page</a> under <i class="fa fa-fighter-jet"></i> COMBAT.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center-align">
                        This section has two subsections - <b>Overall Combat</b> and <b>Class Combat</b> statistics.

                            <p>
                                This section shows the overall combat statistics (kills, deaths etc) and displays not only the total across all alerts also but the per server, per faction distribution. This way you're able to see exactly how many kills the VS got on Miller across all alerts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The statistics that are shown are for Kills, Deaths, Teamkills, Suicides and Headshots.

                                The section shows the comparisons across classes on a per metric, per faction basis e.g. Kills across all classes. These are further broken down into faction compositions, so we can see exactly how many suicides a TR Engineer has made (and there's loads!)

                                I've also added a KDR graph for convenience. This allows people to see relative KDRs across each class. As of writing, the MAX reigns supreme.

                        Alert Real Time Update!
                    </h3>
                    <p class="center-align">
                        After a year long hiatus - and unfortunately being unemployed :-/ - I've taken some time to develop my flagship website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Interested in knowing who's at the top of the leaderboard at any given moment in an alert? Now you'll know!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To that effect, I've now completed the real time mechanics on the alert pages. That means, every kill, death, map capture etc will be reflected on the result page in real time whenever an alert is in progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also taken the opportunity to fix various bugs, layout issues etc and giving the website general polish. If you have any suggestions or bug reports, let me know on the <a href="https://github.com/Maelstromeous/PS2Alerts/issues">GitHub page!</a>
                    </p>

                        This version is the start of something quite big in PS2. The website will soon&trade; have competitive ladders, which will pit you against other players of your server, and globally, and give you a ranking. More on this soon.

                        I'm happy to present the first iteration of Player Profiles! With player profiles, you'll be able to see the statistics for any particular player we have on record, including stats such as:

                        Alert Leaderboards have been implemented on alert pages! You're now able to see what you ranked in each and every alert! There are currently 4 leaderboards: Players, Outfits, Weapons and Vehicles.

                    <p>
                        Project status widgets have been added to the site, detailing the status of the current page you're looking on, keeping you up to date with the progress of the project as well as letting you know where to post suggestions.

                        The initial implementations of the <a href="alert-history">Alert History</a> and <a href="alert/19999">Alert Detail</a> pages have been launched! The Alert History page allows you to see all alerts in the past 48 hours (a temporary measure until a better date selection system can be made) and you're also able to see basic information and leaderboards on a per-alert basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The new version of the website will also feature a complete redesign, as you can see by the very simple example that's shown below. I've learnt a lot about coding since I did PS2Alerts v4.0 back in October last year, so I think it's time to apply said knowledge.
